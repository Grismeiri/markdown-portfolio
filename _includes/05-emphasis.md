# Kuromi クロミ

*Kuromi* is _*My Melody's rival*_, who is a white rabbit or imp-like creature wearing a black jester's hat with a pink skull on the front and a black devil's tail. The skull's facial expression changes to match Kuromi's mood. Fittingly, her birthday is Halloween (October 31st). Her name translates from Japanese to English as "chrome."
